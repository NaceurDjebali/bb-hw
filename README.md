#####  i got stuck at adding an object to the inventory array.
I needed to google a lot of things to get further through the steps of the assignment where if found out a lot of things i could use.
The last stap before i got stuck took me 3 hours and thats where i stopped.
when i tried to push my work i found out my whole pc was staged for committing so at 21:50 i needed to find a way to delete this so i took my half an hour to eventualy push the correct repository. 
my plan is to take a look at this assigment tomorrow and find the answers to the questions i could not finish.
